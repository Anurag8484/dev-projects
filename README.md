# 🌐 Dev Projects – Web Development Cohort Journey

This repository contains a collection of small projects and tools I've built as part of my web development cohort (Cohort 3.0).  
Each project focuses on practicing core web development concepts like:

- CLI tools  
- HTTP servers  
- Express.js APIs  
- File handling  
- JSON processing  

These projects are designed to help reinforce practical skills through hands-on exercises.
